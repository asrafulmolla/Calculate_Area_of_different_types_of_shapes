<h2 align="left">About</h2>
<p>This C++ program is a geometric area calculator. It allows the user to calculate the area of various geometric shapes, including triangles, rectangles, trapeziums, ellipses, squares, parallelograms, circles, and sectors. The program uses a while(1) loop to continuously prompt the user for their choice and calculate the corresponding area until the user decides to exit the program.</p>
<p>In summary, this program serves as a basic geometric area calculator with a user-friendly menu.</p>
